### Tradition of Excellence

The last few years have been an exciting time for the Gamma Tau chapter. We have been awarded 6 consecutive Rock Chapter awards, the highest award offered by Sigma Nu National Fraternity. This award measures chapter performance across all aspects of fraternity life including:
* Academic performance and support
* Service and philanthropy
* Brotherhood
* Values-based recruitment
* Chapter operations
* Campus involvement

We are honored to receive this award and are proud of our Officers, Brothers, and Alumni who have helped build and maintain our tradition of excellence.
