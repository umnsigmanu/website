### Tradition of Excellence

The Gamma Tau chapter of Sigma Nu Fraternity was founded at the University of Minnesota in 1904.

Since our founding, our brothers have built a tradition of excellence and have dedicated their lives to our Fraternity's values of Love, Honor, and Truth.

The last few years have been an exciting time for the Gamma Tau chapter. We have been awarded 6 consecutive Rock Chapter awards, the highest award offered by Sigma Nu National Fraternity. This award measures chapter performance across all aspects of fraternity life including:
* Academic performance and support
* Service and philanthropy
* Brotherhood
* Values-based recruitment
* Chapter operations
* Campus involvement

We are honored to receive this award and are proud of our Officers, Brothers, and Alumni who have helped build and maintain our tradition of excellence.
